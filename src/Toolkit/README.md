# Base .Net Toolkit
A .Net package to facilitate interacting with the following tech stack:
- MongoDb
- Redis
- Kafka
- LaunchDarkly
- Logger with Opentelemetry

## When to use
This package is intended to be used in **.Net applications that are not ASP.Net**, for exemple Console Applications.

## Main functionalities
- Handles setting up the connections with MongoDb, Redis, Kafka and LaunchDarkly
- Exposes functionality to perform most operations on this tech stack while abstracting the implementation details of each technology
- Standardizes the interactions with this tech stack across all the applications that use this package
- Reduces the cost of evolving the interaction with this tech stack across all the applications

**Note:** This package does not intend to completely abstract, from the application, the technology being used.
The application will still need to interact with some data types from the underlying technologies.

# Technical information
## Stack
This package offers functionality for the following technologies:
- MongoDb
- Redis
- Kafka
- LaunchDarkly
- Opentelemetry (logging)

## Installing these packages
```sh
dotnet add [path/to/your/csproj/file] package PJHToolkit
```

## Using this package
This package is structure by technology.<br>
Each one has a dedicated class and an associated utility function.<br>
The utility function receives basic configurations and handles the complexity of setting up the clients and other instances for that technology's SDK.<br>
The output of the utility function is then used to instanciate the class with the functionality to be used by your application.
