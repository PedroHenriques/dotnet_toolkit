# Toolkit for logging with Opentelemetry
## Requirements
This service expect the following `environment variables` to be configured in your application.

| Name | Required | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `LOG_DESTINATION_HOST` | Yes | The `host` of the logstash where logs should be sent to. |
| `LOG_DESTINATION_PORT` | Yes | The `port` of the logstash where logs should be sent to. |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | No | The name of the service that will show up in the logs. |
| `SERVICE_VERSION` | No | The version of the service that will show up in the logs. |
| `PROJECT_NAME` | No | The name of the project that will show up in the logs. |
| `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` | No | The environment the application is running in.<br>**NOTE:** If it has the value `local`, the logs will be sent to the console.<br>If it has `any other value`, the logs will be sent via tcp to a logstash. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | The minimum log level that will generate logs.<br>**NOTE:** Defaults to `warning`. |

## How to use
```c#
using Toolkit;
using Toolkit.Types;

// Setup the logger in a hosted environment
// "builder" is of the type IHostApplicationBuilder
builder = LoggerUtils.PrepareInputs(builder);

// Create a standalone logger
var loggerInputs = LoggerUtils.PrepareInputs("Tester.Program", "Tester", "Main thread");
Toolkit.Types.ILogger logger = new Logger(loggerInputs);
```

In the above snippet we:
- In the first variation:
  - Start by using the `KafkaUtils.PrepareInputs()` utility function to let the Toolkit handle all the necessary setup for interactions with the logger and Opentelemetry.
  - The host's logger will be configured
  - From this point forward when you use the .Net default's ILogger to generate a log it will be in the Opentelemetry standard
- In the second variation:
  - Start by using the `KafkaUtils.PrepareInputs()` utility function to let the Toolkit handle all the necessary setup for interactions with the logger and Opentelemetry
  - An instance of logger inputs is returned
  - Then we instantiate the Toolkit's Logger class
  - Any logs generated by using the Logger class' instance will be in the Opentelemetry standard

The instance of `Toolkit.Types.ILogger` exposes the following functionality:

```c#
public interface ILogger
{
  public void Log(Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel level, Exception? ex, string message);

  public static virtual Activity? SetTraceIds(
    string traceId, string activitySourceName, string activityName, string? spanId = null
  );
}
```

### Log
Generates a log with the provided `level` log level and `message` message.<br>
If an Excpetion is provided in `ex` then the log will contain information extracted from it.<br>
If the log level of the requested log is inferior to the minimum log level defined, then no log will be generated.<br>
**NOTE:** The logs will be sent to 1 of 2 destinations, depending on the environment the application is running:
- If the `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` environment variable **has the value `local`**: The logs will be sent to the console
- If the `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` environment variable **has a value other than `local`**: The logs will be sent, via tcp, to a logstash whose location is determined by the environment variables `LOG_DESTINATION_HOST` and `LOG_DESTINATION_PORT`

**Example use**
```c#
logger.Log(LogLevel.Debug, null, "Tester: some debug message would go here.");
logger.Log(LogLevel.Information, null, "Tester: setup complete.");
logger.Log(LogLevel.Critical, new Exception("Tester: test exception for log"), "Tester: exception logging.");
```

### SetTraceIds
Starts a new Activity with the provided `traceId` trace id, `activitySourceName` activity source name and `activityName` activity name.<br>
If the `spanId` is provided, then the activity will be set with that span id, otherwise a random span id will be used.<br>
**NOTE:** The provided `traceId` and `spanId` must be string representations of valid trace and span ids.
**NOTE:** Any logs generated after calling this method will contain this trace id and span id.
**NOTE:** This method starts a .Net native [Activity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.activity), so it is thread safe and scope contained.

**Example use**
```c#
using var activity = Logger.SetTraceIds("4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736", "MongoDb Watcher", "Change received", ActivitySpanId.CreateRandom().ToString());

// These 2 logs will contain the trace id and span id provided above
logger.Log(LogLevel.Warning, null, "Received event from Mongo Stream:");
logger.Log(LogLevel.Warning, null, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(change));
```
